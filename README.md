# CS Portfolio Automation

This project was developed as part of my Computer Science coursework.  
It automates and demonstrates software engineering practices such as version control, documentation, and reflection.

## 📌 Features
- Organized project artifacts (zipped deliverables, written reflections).
- Demonstrates ability to package and document academic projects.
- Example of automation + portfolio readiness.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Language/Tools: (Add here, e.g., Python, Bash, or just “File Organization / Documentation” if no code)
- GitHub for version control
- Markdown documentation

## 📂 Project Structure
- `contact service pj1.zip` → Project deliverable (zipped source/files)
- `pj2 reflect.docx` → Reflection write-up
- `README.md` → Documentation (this file)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download/unzip the provided project files.
2. Open documentation (`.docx`) for explanation of process.
3. View zipped project content for the original work.

## 🎓 Academic Context
This repo is part of my **SNHU Computer Science program** portfolio, showing my ability to organize and present deliverables for review.
