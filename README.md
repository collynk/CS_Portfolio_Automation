# CS Portfolio Automation

This project was developed as part of my **Computer Science coursework at SNHU**.  
It demonstrates **object-oriented programming in Java**, **JUnit testing with 80%+ coverage**, and **secure coding practices** through a simple Contact/Task/Appointment service system.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Contact Service â†’ Manage contacts with validation on ID, name, phone, and address.  
- Task Service â†’ Manage tasks with constraints on ID, name, and description length.  
- Appointment Service â†’ Schedule appointments, ensuring dates arenâ€™t set in the past.  
- JUnit Tests â†’ 80%+ coverage with assertions for constraints, edge cases, and error handling.  
- Secure Development Practices â†’ Input validation, exception handling, and boundary testing.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Language: Java  
- Testing: JUnit  
- Tools: GitHub for version control, IntelliJ/Eclipse (IDE)  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
**Source files (planned structure):**  
- Contact.java  
- ContactService.java  
- ContactServiceTest.java  
- ContactTest.java  

**Docs:**  
- pj2_reflect.docx â†’ Reflection write-up  
- README.md â†’ This file  

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Unit Test
Contact ID must be less than or equal to 10 characters:

```java
assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
    new Contact("12345678901", "John", "Doe", "1234567890", "123 Elm St");
});

ðŸš€ How to Use

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/collynk/CS_Portfolio_Automation.git

Open in IntelliJ/Eclipse.

Run the JUnit tests to validate services.

ðŸŽ“ Academic Context

This project is part of my SNHU Computer Science portfolio.
It showcases:

Writing modular Java classes.

Aligning code with software requirements.

Applying unit testing and boundary testing.

Thinking about security and code quality early in the lifecycle.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

Add integration and system tests.

Expand documentation with UML class diagrams.

Automate JUnit test runs with GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
